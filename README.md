# Introduction

Business Card is an application I developed by following a module in the Flutter course made by Angela Yu on [App Brewery](https://www.appbrewery.co)

# About The Application

The idea is simple, it is a digital version of a business card that shows your basic contact information such as your phone number and email address. In addition to this it also displays a circular image of yourself.

> Note: This app shows only my information, just for testing purposes.
